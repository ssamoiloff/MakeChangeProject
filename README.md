# Make Change Project - Week 1 Skill Distillery

### Overview
This program calculates change due after a dollar amount has been tendered, and breaks down and lists it in each monetary denomination (e.g. $20 bills, quarters, etc.)

The user is first prompted to enter an amount due. After the user provides a dollar amount, they are then prompted to input the amount they tendered. Once this data is provided, the program outputs a formatted list of any bill(s) and/or coin(s) required to be given as change.

Example:

	Enter item price: 1.01
	Enter amount tendered: 100.00

	Change due is:

		4  $20 bills
		1  $10 bill
		1  $5 bill
		3  $1 bills
		3  quarters
		2  dimes
		4  pennies

### Lessons Learned
* There are many ways of coding to reach the same solution. Some are better than others, some are faster than others, and some are prettier than others.


* Personally, the use of methods has been a huge aid in keeping track of the data flow in my code. It has also helped me in conceptualizing my program more efficiently.


* I learned about the Math.round() method and it was crucial in getting this program to function properly.
